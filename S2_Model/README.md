# Semantic Segmentation Models

This repository contains the implementation of three deep learning models for semantic segmentation tasks:

1. UNet
2. UNet++
3. ResUNet

## Model Architectures

The models are implemented using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend. Each model is defined in a separate Jupyter Notebook:

1. `S1_unet.ipynb`: Implementation of the UNet model.
2. `S2_unetplusplus.ipynb`: Implementation of the UNet++ model.
3. `S3_resnet.ipynb`: Implementation of the ResNet model.

## Usage

To use the models, follow these steps:

1. Open the respective Jupyter Notebook for the desired model.
2. Run the notebook to train the model on your dataset.
3. Save the trained model as `unet_model.keras`, `unet_plusplus.keras`, or `resunet.keras` depending on the model.
