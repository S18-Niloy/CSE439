    "Sure, here's a brief overview of the ResUNet architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder (Residual Blocks):**\n",
    "   - The encoder consists of several layers of convolutional blocks, each followed by a max-pooling layer.\n",
    "   - Each convolutional block contains two convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation, followed by a skip connection to preserve spatial information.\n",
    "   - The skip connection adds the input of the block to the output of the second convolutional layer, ensuring that the gradients flow properly during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bridge:**\n",
    "   - After several downsampling steps, a bridge connects the encoder to the decoder.\n",
    "   - It typically consists of another convolutional block without downsampling, preserving the spatial resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoder (Upsampling Blocks):**\n",
    "   - The decoder is responsible for upsampling the feature maps back to the original input resolution.\n",
    "   - Each upsampling block typically consists of a transposed convolutional layer (or upsampling followed by convolution), followed by a concatenation with the corresponding feature map from the encoder via skip connections.\n",
    "   - This process allows the decoder to recover spatial details lost during downsampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Layer:**\n",
    "   - The final layer of the network is a convolutional layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification tasks (such as in your case with two classes: vegetation and non-vegetation).\n",
    "   - For multi-class segmentation tasks, the output layer would typically have softmax activation."
